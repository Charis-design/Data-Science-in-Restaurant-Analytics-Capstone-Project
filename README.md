I took a bold step to venture into Tech, November 2024 via scholarship offered by Axia Africa, Top most leading tech academy in africa. After studying for 4 months under the best tutor in the world, a very calm, patient well learnered Mr Matthew Oyeniran, with his guidiance and mentorship i was able to carry out my very first project as a data scientist which is tittled data science in restaurant analytics. This project covers a large restaurant data set from accross the world. I was able to study the dataset, understand it, analyze it, offer solutions and build feature predictions using Random Forest Model.
Since this is my first project as data scientist i would appreciate critism other mentors on this platform. i would also appreciate referal for new projects and any available position for a junior data analyst.
I look forward to getting positive reviews and more opportunities. This is the beginning but definitly not the end of my journey as a data scientist. I hope you all enjoy going through this project with me and most importantly, will be awaiting the corrections and suggestion from every one so as to improve. Thank you
